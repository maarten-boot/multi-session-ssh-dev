# Conversation log — 2026-11-02

- **Dependabot alerts.** Open: #6 and #7 (echo/v4 ≤ 4.16.2: X-Real-IP forwarded by the proxy
  middleware, rate-limiter bypass via spoofed X-Forwarded-For), medium; #8 (vite) is now
  marked fixed by Dependabot itself. echo v4.16.3 (2026-10-30) fixes both advisories, but
  the advisory database does not list it yet. echo is used only by Wails' dev server, not in
  the release binary. Decision: wait about two weeks, then update (noted in PLAN "Next").
- **Note: Docker/Podman support for Remote sessions.** Request: containers as agent hosts —
  ssh into the container — with a per-session Edit window for a custom Dockerfile holding the
  project's software requirements. Noted in PLAN "Next" with the open design questions; not
  started.
